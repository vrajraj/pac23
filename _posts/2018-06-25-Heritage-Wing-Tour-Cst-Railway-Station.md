A year ago a certain podcast that revolves around the city of mumbai mentioned a Guided tour that gave acess to the inner floors of a UNESCO world heritage site,very few people in the city of a million people know bout It.

 
Given my love for Trains,Gothic Architecture & History this was like a wet dream to me,freshman year of college and acess being only allowed between 3:00 - 5:00 Pm on weekdays meant inevitable delays.

On Friday the 22nd of june 2018 i finally visited it.

  
The British Ruled india for 200+ years,bringing industrialization, electricity,telegraphy and Gothic Architecture with them. The Victoria Terminus (now renamed to CST) was a result of rapid industrialization that took place in the first half of the colonial rule,The East India Company wanted a railway head for the port city of bombay so that they could transport cotton from the hinterland quickly to be shipped to England.

Anyways moving on ,the musuem was established in 2012 for tourists,sadly due to it being run by a system that is burried deep in beurucray it was opened silently without any advertising,only those who have read about it through obscure blogs on the internet know about it.The railway official who showed me the building mentioned that only 2000 people until now have visited since its opening in 2012.

Everyday about 2 million people travel through the station since it serves as the main train terminal for the lines coming from the Central, South western and northern lines.Majority of the passengers though are residents of the city who are travelling to and from work to the suburbs.Yet no one knows or seems to appriciate the beauty of the structure.

  
The entrance to the musuem is easy to find,there is a large corridoor guarded by a gun position besides the main exist that leads to the grand booking hall which leads to the outer main exit.

One has to go through the security check and continue walking towards the end of the ground floor of the heritage wing.There someone would greet you and all the documents (id proof) shall be checked and tickets shall be purchased.This is where the tour begins.

  
The tour consists of two parts,the first is of the museum that has been established in a room at the ground floor.The second part is a tour of the building itself.

 
The museum consists of various boards displaying historical facts,photogrpahs. The most interesting part of it were the models of the train carriages from yesteryears,the Original blueprints of the station itself and cool signalling systems used in the days of the steam.

Once the musuem tour was done the second part of the tour which is tour of the building itself commences.A senior railway official accompanied us as certain parts of the building are restricted to tourists.

The entrance to the building is the grand staircase that cuves with the wall and leads upto the second floor.At the top a central dome exists that lets in sunlight through its beautiful stained glass.

At the entrance is the statue of a Mythical Gothic creature that resembles a lion.

On the first floor the tourists are lead through the stone passageway to the grand chandelier booking areas viewing room, offering a closer look at the starry gothic style cealing.

At the end of the passageway is a open balcony where tourists can view the opposide southern wing,the parallel Municipal building which was designed in a similar gothic fashion back in the 1800s.
  
The outer walls of the heritage wing are lined by mythical creatures that are supposed to ward of evil spirits, although many of them are as per Victorian standards and designs from the 1800s.

I wanted to visit the glass dome and the clock at the top of the building but access has been restricted due to security concerns,the tour is totally worth the time & effort of travelling all the way to CST from the suburbs of Mumbai,the railways should advertise about it though as very few know that something so wonderful exits in the city.
