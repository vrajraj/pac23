      <description>A year ago a certain podcast that revolves around the city of mumbai mentioned a Guided tour that gave acess to the inner floors of a UNESCO world heritage site,very few people in the city of a million people know bout It.
Given my love for Trains,Gothic Architecture &amp;amp; History this was like a wet dream to me,freshman year of college and acess being only allowed between 3:00 - 5:00 Pm on weekdays meant inevitable delays.</description>
