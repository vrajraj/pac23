### Greetings!

I just keep doing things I love. I write about what I do, and sometimes, about people who annoy me. For anything, contact me at  **manasmangaonkar[at]gmail[dot].com**

I love to code applications in Python & C.It is mostly Python these days, learning  [javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and some go for fun, lost C++ somewhere along the way.  I also love to develop web applications, and use variety of frameworks in many languages which I am not very good at  While I still love webapps, my interests have shifted to OS, Embedded Systems and Devops technologies in general. Professionally, I work with  [Python](https://www.python.org/), can create decent implementations.I post my personal projects on  [Github](https://github.com/abhn)

Other than tech,I also love History,studing Topography & maps.I do also have a know how and interest in Rock/Metal Music.My Current Reading list revolves around technical books and some non-technical non-fiction War History books.

Software and software engineering gems and recommendations

-   The Mythical Man-Month - Fred Brooks (good useful insights about software development methodologies for programmers and programming managers alike)

I always like to be transparent with what is content and what not. For example, advertisement banners will never mix with images anywhere on the blog. They will always be separate and distinguishable. Since I use some services that I write about, there may be an occasional affiliate link, which, if you follow and buy something, will earn me a part of the net amount as commission. Affiliate links will be clearly marked 'affiliated' with no exceptions. There would NEVER be an article for the sake of affiliation or marketing, ever, just to make it clear.
